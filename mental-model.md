title: A mental model for thinking about the impact of a digital product

It takes energy to move stuff around, and so we end up generating CO2 when we burn fossils to move bits around, and when we burn fossil fuels to move physical things around, like people, parcels, and jets full of people, and so on.

Generally speaking, bits are cheaper to move around than atoms, so a shift from say using Netflix to stream a film, over driving to blockbuster to pick up a DVD is a net win.

#### Digital isn't automatically green

There is still an impact though. If we stay with the Netflix example, Netflix quickly grew to become one of Amazon's biggest customers, and it's needs lead to entirely new ways to building applications.

    45% of mobile connections occur over 2G worldwide
    75% of of connections occur on either 2G or 3G




    Back to our baseline, we now have a sense for what our simulated network conditions should be: 400ms RTT, 400Kbps bandwidth. What about the device itself?

This, in turn, drives the single most important trend in setting the global web performance budget hardware baseline: the next billion users will largely come online when they can afford to. This will drive declines in smartphone average-selling-price (“ASP”) in emerging markets for the foreseeable future. This, in turn, means that all improvements to transistor-count-per-dollar will translate into lower selling prices, not faster devices (on average).


This is part of the reason I suggested the Moto G4 last year and recommend it or the Moto G5 Plus this year.

Putting it all together, our global baseline for performance benchmarking is a:

    ~$200 (new, unlocked) Android phone
    On a slow 3G network, emulated at:
        400ms RTT
        400Kbps transfer
