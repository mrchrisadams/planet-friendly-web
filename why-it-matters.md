### More content on the way

This content isn't here yet, but will be soon. In the meantime, you can sign up to hear when the first release of the guide is out.

<!-- My aim today is to provide you with some context for how what we do fits into this wider picture, and share a mental model for thinking about building apps with this in mind, along with some examples of how this relates to your work.

I’ll be mentioning carbon dioxide a few times today, so I’m going to start with a quick reminder on the greenhouse effect. Here’s more or less how it works:

Sunlight hits earth.

When energy from the sun hits Earth, some of it ends up warming the planet, and some bounces back off into space. What’s special about Earth though is that it has large enough quantities of certain gases within the atmosphere, primarily CO2, to bounce some of the energy back to Earth again.

This energy warms up the planet, so we refer to these gases as greenhouse gases, and the phenomenon as the greenhouse effect.

So, this greenhouse effect has been very useful to us. It’s made life possible in the first place.

Over the last 100 years or so, largely as a result of human activity, we’ve ended up with greater levels of greenhouse gases, and in particular CO2, in the atmosphere.

More CO2 results in a more powerful greenhouse effect, resulting in more energy in the system, and a warmer world.

While warmer world sounds nice, it turns out that the reality is less nice.

The reality is more extreme weather events, more drought, more destruction to vital ecosystems we rely on, and in general, problems of the kind that scientists describe as existential threats, and ones that can only really be solved by collective action.

So, since the mid-nineties, we (and by we, I mean the countries making up the United Nations) have been meeting every year for a series of huge, long meetings, to agree on what to do about this, the aforementioned existential threat to our civilisation.

And finally, after 21 goes at getting it right, in 2015 in Paris – more or less everyone agreed that we definitely want to limit climate change, and we also want to aim for to less than 2 degrees of global warming in total.

This effectively created a ceiling on the total amount of greenhouse gases we can emit as a planet – a carbon budget, so if we want to stay inside this budget, our emissions need to go a bit like this (short video of showing the emissions drop off from Bret Viktor’s essay  What can a technologist do about climate change? A personal view)

Getting an agreement like the one in Paris was quite impressive, but what’s even more amazing, is that people are actually following through with the agreement, and changing how their economies work.

According to the International Energy Agency, 2017 is the third year where global emissions didn’t increase, but the global economy still grew.

So, we’re seeing a decoupling of economic growth from emissions – and we can now point to this happening in America and China, the two biggest emitters as they move away from coal, while their economies continue to grow.

That said though, before we start feeling too proud of ourselves, we do need a sense of perspective.

Because it’s taken this long to reach a turning point, as a civilisation, we need to reduce our emissions much more aggressively than a few years ago if we want to stay within 2 degrees. The blue line here shows what we needed to do in 1995, and the red line onwards shows how much faster emissions need to fall now as a result of our inaction.

Okay, so we have established that:

we can change our economies
we have a lot of work to do
we need to do it fast
Where do we start?

This Sankey diagram from 2010 shows a rough breakdown of global emissions by sector and gas. The bit on the left shows the key sources of emissions, the middle bit shows emissions by sector responsible for them, and the bit on the right shows which gases are responsible for the Greenhouse effect.

Agriculture is about 7%, and road transport is about 10%, like deforestation (filed euphemistically as “land use change” here), and energy generation is about 13%.

Flying, which is one we hear a lot about only shows up as a between 1 and 2 percent of global emissions. IT doesn’t even show up – it’s just lumped in with the other categories.

And this is a key thing when talking about climate change and the environment, if you woke up tomorrow and thought “I HAVE to do something important about climate change” you wouldn’t start with changing how you design your websites.

There are important discussions to have about our diets, (i.e. how much meat we eat, how keep homes warm or cool, how we travel around the world by car or fly, and so on).

However, I’m not here to talk about that, as it’s far beyond the scope of the time I have. Instead, I’m here to talk about our impact when we build things online.

This deck, citing the Climate Groups Smart 2020 report shows IT at around 2% of planetary CO2 emissions in 2007 – about the same as aviation.

Remember how much power generation (i.e. electricity) contributed to emissions in the last graph? Well, as an industry, we’re getting pretty power hungry. I live in Germany, currently the 4th largest economy on Earth. Deutsche Telekom is the 3rd largest consumer of electricity in the country.

And in three years time, as an industry, we’re predicted to be responsible for twice the emissions as aviation.

So we may have started as a small part of emissions, but we’re growing fast. And as web developers, while we might not have direct control over deforestation, we do have rather more control over how we might use data centres and infrastructure for shipping our bits to our users.
