When someone mentions climate change to you, it might conjure up images of dirty great coal fired power stations, oil wells and gas guzzling cars, or deforestation in the Amazon.

It typically won't make you think of smiling tech CEOs walking around their datacentres, or slick websites as a source of emissions leading to climate change.

In fact, for the most part, we tend to pin our hopes on IT and technology as a way out of this mess. While technology obviously has a huge part to play in the future, it's not fit for purpose in it's current state.

I'm hoping that in this section, I can help you understand why, as people building the web, we might take the climate into account when we're making decisions about the digital products we build.

### Climate change is already causing the wrong kind of disruption to our world

If you've had someone speak to you about climate change, then it's likely that have come across the phrase _Global Warming_ before. It's a nice sounding phrase.

It can make you think of palm trees, champagne grapes in Britain, or warm holidays in sunny places. And while warmer world sounds nice, it turns out that the reality is less nice.

The reality is more extreme weather events, more drought, more destruction to vital ecosystems we rely on, and in general, problems of the kind that scientists describe as _existential threats_, and ones that can only really be solved by collective action.

### We've already agreed to reduce our emissions

The conversation we're having about climate is not a new one, and since the mid nineties, you country's government has been assembling with governments of almost every other country on earth each year, to try to agree on what to do about this aforementioned existential threat to our civilisation.

And finally, after 21 goes at getting it right, in 2015 in Paris – more or less everyone agreed that we definitely want to limit climate change, and we also want to aim for to less than 2 degrees of global warming in total.

_So to be clear - as a planet we have agreed that this needs to happen_

This is important, as there are many decisions embedded in this decision to limit change to less than 2 degrees C.

<!-- * Well, 191 out of 192 countries that make up the United Nations -->

### Two degrees of change limits the greenhouse gases we can leave in the atmosphere

If we want to stay within two degrees of climate change, we have a budget of about 800 gigatonnes of CO2 we can emit, and each year, we need to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we emit.

#### This is possible

According to the International Energy Agency, 2017 is the third year where global emissions didn’t increase, but the global economy still grew.

We’re seeing a decoupling of economic growth from emissions – and we can now point to this happening in America and China, the two biggest emitters as they move away from coal, while their economies continue to grow.


#### Winning too slowly will be the same as losing

Because it’s taken this long to reach this turning point, as a civilisation, we need to reduce our emissions much more aggressively than a few years ago if we want to stay within 2 degrees.

The blue line here shows what we needed to do in 1995, and the red line onwards shows how much faster emissions need to fall now as a result of our inaction.

### Greenhouse gases from IT is one of the fastest growing sources

_(sankey diagram)_

This Sankey diagram from 2010 shows a rough breakdown of global emissions by sector and gas. The bit on the left shows the key sources of emissions, the middle bit shows emissions by sector responsible for them, and the bit on the right shows which gases are responsible for the Greenhouse effect.

Agriculture is about 7%, and road transport is about 10%, like deforestation (filed euphemistically as “land use change” here), and energy generation is about 13%.

Flying, which is one we hear a lot about only shows up as a between 1 and 2 percent of global emissions. In 2010, IT didn't even show up – it was just lumped in with the other categories.

In the late 2010's though, things look different. If the internet was a country its emissions would be larger than California, and most US states, and most European countries. It's also growing faster than the previous fastest growing source, aviation, and by 2020, it will have doubled.

So, what can we do about it? And where does the footprint occur? WE'll cover this in the next part when we introduce a [Mental Models](/mental-models) for thinking about this.

#### A very brief segway

If you woke up tomorrow and thought _I HAVE to do something important about climate change_, you wouldn’t *start* with changing how you design your websites.

There are important discussions we need to have about our diets, (i.e. how much meat we eat, and how it's farmed), our homes (how we keep homes warm or cool), and how we choose where we live (i.e. how we plan our towns, the transport we rely on, and so on) if want a fighting chance at avoiding climate change.

They need to happen _as well as this discussion_.
