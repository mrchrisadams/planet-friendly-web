### The internet is a great thing. It is also the biggest machine on earth, and it runs mostly on coal, creating a huge carbon footprint, which is bad news for our climate.

### So, what can we do? Well, we might not be able to stop using the web, but can change how we build it, to make it planet friendly as well as user friendly.

### This guide exists to tell you how.

## Your Platform. Your Packets. Your Process

Split into three main sections, the planet friendly web guide is an open source, freely available set of tools and resources, to help you improve the user experience of online products you make, reduce the cost of running them, and reduce the cost of using them for your users.

## Sound good?
