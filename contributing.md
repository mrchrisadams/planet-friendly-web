### Want get involved?

That's great news - huzzah!

This might be a good time to share the vision of this project, to help give an idea what this is all about:

> work with web professionals, campaigners, and academics, to build tools and information resources for web professionals, so that they can understand and radically reduce the environmental impact of the web

Note: the scope of this guide is limited to what can realistically be done to change the impact _of using and building the web_, over _effecting change via the web_.

For example, while going vegan and not flying on holidays are effective steps to reduce a personal carbon footprint, they wouldn't fit in this guide. There's plenty of useful information about this already.

Running everything on renewable power, and making it easier to replace long work commutes with remote work, would be a better fit, as this isn't covered so much yet.

_You don't need to be an expert in cliamte change, or a ninja coder to help out on this guide. As long as you're interested in up for learning, and prepared to follow the code of conduct, we'll do our best to make contributing a rewarding experience._

### Who are we?

We are a (tiny) group of friendly people, with an interest in the transformative power of the web, and in climate change. You can see a bit more in the contact page on https://www.planetfriendlyweb.com/about

### How you can help

The first, easiest thing - vote on the bits that interest you on this Trello board.

If you have time, and you don't see a matching question already, try adding a comment phrased as a question that you'd want to be able to answer by reading the content in this part of the guide.

The goal here is to help shape the content, so it's useful to readers, and helps answers the questions people come to with.

An example might look like:

> What difference does it make to the carbon footprint of a site if it's powered by electricity generated from burning coal, compared to using renewables?

### If you have expertise in the field of CSR and environmental sustainability

Much of this guide relies on data in reports, and papers, and in some cases, speaking directly to experts or practitioners. Given how fast technology changes, it's important to base the guide on up to date information, and if you know of more reent publications, we'd love to hear about them.

If you're not comfortable with making contributions via github, that's totally okay - we'll help you with your first pull request.

Alternatively, if you're up to a phone call or skype call to share your subject expertise, we can arrange a time for this, or you can

### If you are comfortable using github, markdown, or html/css

The Planet Friendly Web Guide exists as a static website, written largely in Markdown for the various sections. It uses TachyonCSS as a the CSS framework, as it's small, well documented, and relatively easy to use.

The general (ideal) workflow typically looks like:

- claim an issue on github, or create a new one
- create a pull request for the changes
- discuss any changes in the PR
- PR gets merged - high fives all round

### If you're interested in user research and UX

If you're comfortable interviewing users, or you're looking for practice doing so, you can volunteer to buddy up on interviews. The goal here is to help capture the key points from speaking to users of the guide, as well as subject matter experts, so content can be revised, or new sources added.




### If you are up for reading early versions of the guide

You might just be interested in reading versions of the guide as they're written, and giving feedback on the content and clarity. That' extremely valuable. When you sign up to the mailing list,
