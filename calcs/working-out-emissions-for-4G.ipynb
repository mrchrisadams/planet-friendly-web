Under typical circumstances, with 2010 technology, the energy consumption of a 4G LTE wireless access link ranges between 328 micro-Joules per bit and around 615 micro-Joules per bit [42]. The current annual energy efficiency improvement for wireless systems is approximately 26% [52]. Therefore, the 2010 values need to be adjusted to represent the expected energy per bit in 2015. This gives values of 73 micro-Joules per bit and 136 micro-Joules per bit. This paper adopted the lower value of 73 micro-Joules per bit\n",
