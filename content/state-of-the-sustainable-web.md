Things have moved on since

> In some ways it’s got easier to do the right thing we if we want to our tech to be sustainable and planet friendly. But changes in technology, and our industry mean that things we were recommending just 3 years ago might not be the most effective things to concentrate on now. In many cases we need to be able to navigate this together, and learn the lessons from each other as we go.

> In this talk, Sustainable UX veteran Chris Adams and Climate Action Tech organiser will give you overview of how changes in the fields of UX, cloud computing and web performance, and product design for Internet of Things, affect the environmental impact of what we’re building.

> In each area, you’ll learn the useful toolkits and frameworks for thinking about making a measurable improvements, (with explorable, worked examples) before showing where to go to dive more deeply on each subject.
