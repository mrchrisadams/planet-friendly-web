### More content on the way

This content is in a messy, draft state, but it'll be . In the meantime, you can sign up to hear when the first release of the guide is out. The rough sections are below:

## How it happens

In short, CO2 emissions occur whenever we generate electricity, and we haven't used renewable energy to do so. And right now, about 70% of the energy used to power the web runs on fossil fuels. Historically the most common fossil fuel we've used has also been coal, which about the worst fuel we could be burning, environmentally speaking. It's been chosen before largely because it's cheap, and within relatively easy access, but it kills more people per kilowatt hour than any other commonly used fuel, emits more radioactive matter than any other fuel (including nuclear), and in general, burning it for electricity is bad news for our future.

It's not the only fossil fuel in common use. Depending on which country you live in, there may be natural gas in the mix (especially in the UK), which burns cleaner, and can often be cheaper, but again still ends up emitting CO2 for each unit of electricity generated. Oil, is somewhere between the other two main fossil fuels, and it's common for datacentres to maintain stocks of fuel oils, like diesel, in case of power outages on the national grid.

Generally speaking if we want to generate electricity without emitting CO2 in the process, renewables are the way to go, and this is where the internet can claim a success story: a significant driver in renewable purchases in America between has been internet giants like Amazon and Google making large investments in renewable energy to power some of their datacentres.

This is easier in some parts of the world than others though, while we touched on it before, it's worth being more explicit - the mix of power that goes into generating the energy to power for running our infrastructure affects the amount of greenhouse gases we

### Energy mix around the world, and the time of day

Different places have different mixes of power generating energy. Iceland is full of geothermal so runs on very clean power.

Places like France use lots of nuclear energy and are also low, but places like Poland are massively into coal.

This affects the carbon emissions associated with running networks or computing in these regions.

### Wired vs wireless

Wired communication is inherently more efficient than wireless, because well… air is an insulator, and wires are conductors.

As such, our shift to more wireless means of transmitting data means more electricity is needed to move the same data.

### 3G vs 4G vs 5G

But we don't just move the same data. We move more, and much more of it.

This quote here from

> The new high-­‐speed LTE networks that accelerate the mobile Internet require up to three times more data per hour per task compared to the previous slower 3G networks, and thus more energy. And compared to 2G networks, LTE energy consumption is 60 times greater to offer the same coverage.

On top of that, different speeds of wireless connection _also_ use different amounts of power, so a relatively fast 4G connection typically uses more energy to download the same amount of data as a 3G, and a 5G connection is likely to use more still, even before we take into account their typically reduced range, meaning we'll need more of them to cover the same area.


## Steps you can take

### Make packets green

We don't have direct control over the network, especially the 'last mile', where ISPs or mobile operators control the infrastructure. To affect this, you would need to run your own cellular network, and make sure it runs on renewable power, or you'd need to convince the likes of Verizon, O2, Vodafone and so on to for you.



### Make them count

We _do_ have control over how much data we end up sending over the wire, and fortunately there is a whole industry's worth of work we can draw upon here.
