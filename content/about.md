### What is the Planet Friendly Guide?

The planet friendly web guide is an open source, freely available guide, for people building the web who are interested in understanding and improving the environmental impact of the online products and websites they create.

### Who's behind this?

This is an open project, and a [full list of contributors](/humans.txt), and currently part of the Mozilla Open Leadership programme.

At present, the primary author is [Chris Adams](http://chrisadams.me.uk). He runs a small company, [Product Science](https://productscience.co.uk), and is working to make the ideas of [Planet Friendly Web Development](http://planetfriendly.productscience.co.uk), as easy to apply as possible and spread them far and wide.

This project is mentored by [Chris Hartgerink](https://twitter.com/chartgerink), a Mozilla Open Leadership Mentor, and a 2017 Mozilla Science fellow, with added guidance from [Abigail Cabunoc Mayes](https://twitter.com/abbycabs).

_If any of this interests you, you are very welcome to take part - see [contributing](/contributing) for more._
